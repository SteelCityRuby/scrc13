          <h1>SPONSORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES</h1>

          <p>
          After an incredibly successful first year, Steel City Ruby Conference is
          returning for its second year as a premiere regional Ruby conference! With a
          heavy focus on creating a welcoming environment, Steel City Ruby has become not
          only a conference about the technology that we use, but also a conference of
          the community.
          </p>

          <p>
          Last year’s success wouldn’t have been possible without the help of our
          community of sponsors. Steel City Ruby Conference 2012 was sold out months in
          advance to nearly 300 attendees. We hope to continue that momentum in 2013 to
          bring in nearly 400 developers and sponsor representatives.
          </p>

          <p>
          You can help us achieve that success again and reach conference attendees as
          potential customers, employees or users.
          </p>
